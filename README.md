# Logic-Gate-Terminal-Program

This project will show my understanding of logic gates to make a logic gate program in the termninal (with no fancy visuals).

**The program does the following:**
* Takes two inputs 
* Lets user choose a list of logic gates
* Outputs the result based on the input and the logic gate selected. 

**Future Plans**
* Make truth table of the logic gate selected
* When output is given, it also outputs a small explanation of the gate's functionality
